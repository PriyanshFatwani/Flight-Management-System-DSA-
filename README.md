# Flight-Management-System-DSA-
An airline management system is a software solution designed to streamline and automate the operations of an airline. It is developed for efficient management of incoming and outgoing airplanes at an airport. Different real-life problems are faced while managing airplanes such as airplane parking, avoiding bad weather routes, and finding the shortest path from one city to another. This system allows airlines to manage these problems and find the optimal solution. The airline management system provides operational solutions to help airlines optimize their operations and make informed decisions. By using an airline management system, airlines can provide a seamless and hassle-free travel experience for their passengers, making it an essential tool for modern airline management. I call it Happy Airlines.
